A good simple problem is to put the cell phone towers at the corners of a square: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3), and the cell phone user at the center of the square (2,2). The cell phone user is than equiditant from each tower, with distance $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$. But due to some noise or innaccuracy, the distances to those four towers are measured as $r = (1.41, 1.45, 1.43, 1.42)$, respectively.\n",
